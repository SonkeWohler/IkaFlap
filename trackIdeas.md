# IkaFlap Idea tracker
This file is used to note down ideas and plans for the project. This replaces any workflow organisation tool for one person projects because they can be a bit of a hassle when you are just working by yourself.

## Project Description
This is my first game and my first time working in Unity. I want to learn to make simple 2D games witht he use of sprites and the C language for coding; the rest should be handled by the Unity Engine. 

### Overall Plan
#### Art and Story
I think it would be good to demonstrate my creativity to create a new artstyle, perhaps inspired by the legend of Ikarus (hence 'IkaFlap'). The bird would be an Ikarus, the pipes would be giant pillars lined with candles placed there by the Gods to stop him from reaching Heaven/Mount Olympus. Perhaps this story would allow for some form of level setup, but lets not get carried away, its a practice project after all.
#### Gameplay
In its simplest form it should be exactly like FlappyBird. I was hoping to put a little more effort into polishing, like having more detailed sprites, but this will depend on the amount of time available.  

However, perhaps I could try and tweak the difficulty a little bit. The original FlappyBird autogenerates its pipes, probably with increasing difficulty as you progress simply by making it more iradic. I would like to be able to adjust things a little and allow the player to set the difficulty through these adjustments. We'll see how that goes...
This is what I would say could fascilitate some form of levels, where you start with the simplest settings and progress in discrete steps (levels). Some form of level winning animation could offer the player a reward like this.



## Possible Improvements
### Workflow
So far for a one person 2D project the current setup should be fine. I followed the instructions of Rick Relly on [thoughtbot 'How to Git with Unity'](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity/), excluding those for large binary files. Given the nature of the project that should not be a problem. However, he also suggests [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) for better workflows following good practice, which is something I should get into.
