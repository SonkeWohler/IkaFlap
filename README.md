## Style Guides
I.e. conventions for coding and perhaps other aspects
### `C#`
Try to stick with the Google style guide for Java, where applicable, i.e.:
 * Dissable automatic `new line` basically always.
   In particular don't make it look like:
   ```
     void Goo()
	 {
	 
	 }
   ```
   but instead like:
   ```
   void Goo() {
   
   }
   ```
 * Set the `Tab` spacing to `2`
 * To be continued...
